# covid-19-structural-coefficients-of-its-interacting-proteins
Causality is crucial in understanding biological processes. Here we describe covid-19 interacting proteins and their structural coefficients. Using molecular weights and their coefficients one can calculate causal strength.

Covid-19 related interacting human proteins are obtained from IntAct EML-EBL website and processed for deriving structural coefficients using McNemar statistical analysis (see il29.txt). We used IL-2, IL-7, IL-9 and their interactions with IL-15 as query for the data. 

Sample query for McNemar data is shown in eval.sh and mcnemar1.py.
Molecular weights used for causal reasoning is given shown in mass_pid2.txt.

Structural coefficients alpha, beta are given in human_ipr_alpha_beta.txt

Paper describing details of causal strengths and their import is under preparation.
